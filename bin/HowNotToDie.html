				<div class="innertube"><h1>The Basics:</h1></div>
				<h3>Our Hero</h3> 
				<div id="subitem">
					<p>Our Hero's purpose in life is to possess the power of the Luminous Fireball. He gets happy when he touches it. But when he touches it, the fireball teleports to a new location. Yes, highly frustrating. Because of this inner battle and emotional turmoil, our hero may never reach his full happiness potential. But alas, he keeps trying, as should you.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Our Goal</h3> 
				<div id="subitem">
					<p>Our goal is called the Luminous Fireball from the mysterious planet of Naps. When an individual is able to possess the Luminous Fireball, he (or she) is filled with an immense feeling of pleasure and contentment. Anyone who touches the fireball is also bequeathed tremendous power and virility. Our hero will not rest until he has it in his grasp.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>That Dastardly Villain</h3> 
				<div id="subitem">
					<p>Every story of good, has an element of evil. Our story is no different. Our Dastardly Villain has an immense desire to protect the Luminous Fireball from invaders of all animal species and humanoid forms. With each hero's touch of the Fireball, our villain becomes more enraged and focused on his need to fill the world with disdain. (He's one of those types that only feels pleasure in the misery of others, but we digress...) Our Villain has the ability to clone himself and, if you last long enough, you'll have a mob of Dastardlies on your heels. The Dastardly Villain will not stop until those who yearn for the pleasurable sensation, one can only get from the possession of the Luminous Fireball, cease to exist in the OpenGL galaxy.</p>

					<li>The Villain gets faster! MUWAhaha!</li>

				<b>What happens when the Villain(s) touches you?</b><br />
				<ul>
					<li>You Die, pretty simple.</li>

		<div class="innertube"><b>How to Win:</b> 
			<p> You can't win, you can only attempt to fend off the villain longer than any other being.
				Your High, Last, and Current score is always available, so you could always consider a new high score as a win.<br />
				<br />
				When the Villain grabs you, the game starts over, resetting your current score, setting a new last score, and, if you're lucky, a new high score.<br />
